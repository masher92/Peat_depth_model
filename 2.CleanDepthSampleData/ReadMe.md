### Cleaning data

Peat depth measurement data was provided by Yorkshire Peat Partnership for four areas in the Yorkshire Dales:
* Humberstones
* Melbecks and Reeth
* Newhouse
* Stake Moss

The 'PeatDepthPointsCleaning.R' script provides code to clean the four spatial datasets to ensure they all have consistent formatting.  
This includes:
* The name of the depth column
* The formatting of the depth column
* Removing any additional columns with unneeded data

The final research work, however, focussed solely on the Humberstone area.
