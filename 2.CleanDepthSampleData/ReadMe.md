### Cleaning data

Peat depth measurement data was provided by Yorkshire Peat Partnership for four areas in the Yorkshire Dales:
* Humberstones
* Melbecks and Reeth
* Newhouse
* Stake Moss

The final research work focussed solely on the Humberstone area.  
However, the 'PeatDepthPointsCleaning.R' script provides code to clean the four spatial datasets to ensure they all have consistent formatting.  
This includes:
* The name of the depth column
* The formatting of the depth column
* Removing any additional columns with unneeded data
